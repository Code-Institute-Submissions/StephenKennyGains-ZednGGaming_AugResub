# ZednGGaming

This site is intended to show the multi-platform content of Irish Games Streamer, Zedng, in one location with the future intention of also adding a market place for merchandise and subscritpion services. The page links and highlights ZedNG's Twitch and Youtube content and adds an additonal method for new fans to join his Discord server.

ZedNG streams games regualarly to Twitch and uploads highlights of the streams to Youtube as highlight reels. As his following grows he intends to sell merchandise to his audience and the intention of the website will be to both, bring twitch followers over to his youtibe channel and vice-versa along with having regular traffic to the site so when his online store is ready there will already be a steady traffic flowe through the site.

## Features 

The site is broken into 3 main sections being Twitch, Youtube and Contact which leads to his Discord channel. 

Twitch- This section is designed to highlight his top streamed games and currently streamed games to show his audience what games are currently in roatation and the type of content they can expect. Along with his own streams, there are also recommended channels he enjoys and fellow streamers he works with regularly for cross promotion. 

Each image of both games and streamers is a hyperlink redirecting the user to a seperate page on Twitch where they can jump straight to the stream or user highlighted for easy access to his content.

Youtube- This section shows his most recent uploads and highlights some of his favourite clips along with displaying some variety to his content as a highlight to show diversity in his streams. The videos uploaded can play in screen to avoid leaving the page and also have the option to watch directly on youtube to bring users to his youtibe page. Additionally there are some of his preferred Youtube users to give an insight into his preferred viewing.

Contact page- This page is the most basic design to avoid any confusion through this section by just keeping it as a simple form with a descriptive title telling the user what completing the form will accomplish.

### Navbar and Footer

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The navigation bar features the site logo which brings the user back to the home page, the page title and links to the Home, Twitch, Youtube and Contact page. 
  - The colour chosen was to be easily ditinguished from the black borders and outlines of other features whilst still being a contrasting colour to the vibrant colour schemes of the main pages.

- __Footer__

  - The footer follows the same colour scheme as the header for a uniform design. 
  - The features have been kept minimal to only show my own details, social links to the instagram and github repository and copyright info.

- __Home Page Hero image__

  - The home page uses a hero image at the head of it to show that the page is directed towards gaming by featuring a gaming setup which uses similar vibrant colours to those of the page.
  -There is a short text overlay to show immeidately to users what the page is about and what to expect.

- __Twitch Section__

  - The Twitch section gives a preview of the type of content on the full Twitch page of the site and offers a quick access section to view content immediately upon landing on the page.
  - The colour scheme used is that of Twitch's brand.

- __Youtube Section__

  - Following the same pattern as the twitch section this gives users the option to view youtube content directly on the site without moving to Youtube. 
  - The colour scheme again follows that of Youtubes brand but with the transparency increased to make it a more pleasant view to the user as the vibrancy is too strong on such a large scale.

- __Contact Section__ 

  - The contact section is more minimal on the home page to follow the same design as the Contact page itself. It gives a short amount of information along with a button to redirect to the contact page.
  - The whole page has an underlay of various gaming symbols that are associated with ZedNG such as the Twitch logo, Discord Logo, Xbox logo and a gamepad which helps to reduce the dominance of the colour schemes and also gives users a very clear insight into the pages intentions.

- __Gallery__

  - The gallery will provide the user with supporting images to see what the meet ups look like. 
  - This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to easily identify the types of events the organisation puts together.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
