<h1> Welcome to ZednGGaming </h1>
<h2> This site is designed to combine the different Media platforms for Games Streamer ZedNG </h2>
<p> The aim of this website is to take the streaming platforms of games streamer ZedNG such as Twitch, Youtube and his Discord channels and bring them all to one easy to find location. In the future as ZedNG builds his viewers and following, he hopes to sell merchandise and packages. Having an established website would help to bring in his traget audience and to increase sales if converted to an e-commerce site. Below you will find the wireframe for the initial design for the website and overall layout. </p>
![Wireframe](https://github.com/StephenKennyGains/ZednGGaming/blob/master/assets/images/Balsam_home_page.png?raw=true)
<p> From the wireframe you will see that there will be stacked and in line cards and images for each section to highlight a lot of content through the homepage. This will then have a button redirecting the user to a page containing the full list of content for that particular section. The additonal pages will be for Twitch Content, Youtube Content and a contact page which will be a form directing to add people to the Discord server. </p>

<p> The page is broken into sections and colour co-ordinated with the brand of the asscociated media platform eg. purple for twitch and red for youtube. I chose colours which I felt gave a more neutral but stand out feel for the the header, footer and font colours. In line with the gaming community I tried to design the website with strong colours and features which have the tone set for them by the hero image of a gaming keyboard at a gaming setup. To avoid the colours being too strong, I changed the opacity of the colours and added an overlay which I made on illustrator to show the logos of some of the platforms of the site and also of releavant gamer assocaiated icons such as a controller and microsofts xbox logo. </p>

<p> Hvaing experimented around with float values for the images in the Twitch section of the page, I opted to change from float values and use flexbox. The flexbox css values gave me more flexibility to re-use the same css for different sections with minimal changes. It also made it easier to make adjustments to the media queries while remaining close to the desktop view of the site. I adjusted the header, Twitch section and Youtube section to flexbox css values for consistancy throughout the page and noteably used flex-wrap to adjust the amount of cards diplayed on different media sizes </p>
